A utility program im working on.
<br>
Booftutils is very unigue.
In contrary to other utility programs, Boofutils uses a sh*t ton of memory.

## Download
I recommend that you build this program from source.
You need to install libasound and pkg-config.
 If you are using a Debian based distro, you can install them with `sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config`.

 After you have installed them you can simply clone the repo and build it. These commands should be the same on all operating systems.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hexahigh/boofutils
cd boofutils
go build
```
If you are using Windows or don't want to build from source, you can download the latest release from [here.](https://github.com/hexahigh/boofutils/releases/tag/latest_auto)
